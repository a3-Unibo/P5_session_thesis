GENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nSketches from the 2-days session with thesis students (04 and 06 July 2015)\r\n\r\nGeneral topics: basic behavior and object oriented programming\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n#.:. SKETCH EXPLANATION\r\n\r\n***. class_01***\r\n\r\nIntroductory sketch. Simple class definition and application. Basics of vector applied to dynamic behavior such as motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n***. seek_class***\r\n\r\nSteering behavior, with options for slowing down on approach and tail visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n***. PGraphics_example***\r\n\r\nSimple use of auxiliary PGraphics in a Processing sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n***. rwField_class***\r\n\r\nParticles moving influenced by a variable noise field and writing on a stigmergy field. Please wait a few seconds for the sketch to show something.\r\n\r\n\r\n***. rwStigField_class***\r\n\r\nParticles moving influenced by a variable noise field and reading/writing on a stigmergy field. Evolution of the previous sketch.\r\nStigmenrgy allows communication through peers by means of an external environment (the StigField class in this case).\r\n\r\n***. rwStigField_interface***\r\n\r\nEvolution of the sketch above with an interface designed with ControlP5 library. Allows to control stigmergy decay, noise field update, steering behavior, noise field display, stigmergy display, particles display, stop/go, reset and image export.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n#.:. KNOWN BUGS\r\n\r\n. there might be a few here and there, especially in the first sketches as things got developed first to last in the list of sketches. Most bugs in one sketch were corrected in the following one.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n#.:. IMPLEMENTATIONS\r\n\r\n. none foreseen at the moment.\r\n",
